Abstract
This study sheds light on interconnected topic dynamics across traditional news
sources and social media platforms, emphasizing the inﬂuential role of topicality
in shaping content popularity in social media. Using the Latent Dirichlet Allo-
cation and BERTopic models, we deﬁne sets of 120 New York Times (NYT)
topics to compare with 899,766 image-with-text memes from Reddit, showing
that social media content aligns with many of the same topical patterns observed
in news outlets. Topicality is formalized based on the temporal distributions of
the topics over the past 5 years. Using these topicality features, the investigation
reveals signiﬁcant correlations between the rising popularity of NYT topics and
increased average upvotes on Reddit, particularly evident in “innovator” memes
posted during the early stages of a topic’s prevalence in the NYT. Furthermore,
topicality features show signiﬁcant predictive power over other content-based
control features in a CatBoost classiﬁer prediction of viral Reddit memes.

11 Introduction
Popular content from social media sites such as Reddit provides a window into the
opinions and interests of internet users. As people are spending more time on the
internet, the question of what they are engaging with has come to the forefront.
However, the forces underlying the emergence of popular internet content are still
little understood. Particularly, the inﬂuence of memes’ topics on their popularity has
not yet been analyzed. Do social media sites discuss the same issues as veriﬁed news
sources? Are topical subjects that are currently prevailing in the news more likely to
go viral on social media too? Is it worth “riding the wave” of topicality, or does interest
in a topical subject decline rapidly on social media sites?
The widespread prevalence of image-with-text memes online shows how well-suited
the internet is to multi-modal reasoning and communication. Although video, sound,
and image data are more complicated to analyze than pure text data, making it
less studied in the literature, our understanding of online communication would be
incomplete without these analyses ( Halevy et al. ,2022). To address this shortage of
multi-modal analyses, here we study image-with-text memes. These are usually images
with overlaid text that are copied and shared extensively across the internet. Due to
higher information density, images are more succinct than pure text content. They grab
our attention and are able to rapidly communicate complicated messages ( Nelson et al. ,
1976). Like many forms of online media, the topic of a meme is not only communicated
through the text caption but also through the underlying image.
In the digital age, many are concerned about losing the depth of conversation in the
short-form discourse of the internet. However, social media content may simply achieve
nuance in diﬀerent ways than longer-form written communication. Multi-modality is
one way of conveying nuance online. The level of nuance conveyed in online communi-
cation is further enhanced by referencing relatable and popular topics in society. The
mechanism of reference is especially important to memes, which are elsewhere deﬁned
exactly as a reference to reality followed by a punchline ( Spitzberg ,2014). By identi-
fying meme topics, we connect the individual pieces of media to the broader discourse
they are a part of. Using big data, we analyze overall trends in the discourse across 5
years of data.
Memes often reference cultural and political themes ( Brodie ,2009;Du et al. ,2020).
They can be used to consolidate group identities ( Dynel and Messerli ,2020) and
inﬂuence opinions ( McClure ,2016). The work of Zannettou et al. (2018) labeled memes
from four social media sites with annotations from the Know Your Memes (KYM)
website, indicating whether a meme template has political content. They found that
memes on many social media sites contain political content, and on Reddit political
memes are more popular than non-political memes. Today, over half of U.S. adults get
news from social media ( Jacob Liedke and Luxuan Wang ,2023). Furthermore, political
memes have the potential to inﬂuence social actions and perceptions. For example, one
study found that images shared online to promote the Black Lives Matter movement
led to greater political action ( Leach and Allen ,2017). More recently, TikTok has
been used to increase public engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian conﬂict ( Yarchi and
Boxman-Shabtai ,2023). Importantly, online information is not always trustworthy
and memes containing quotes and factual information have been shown to change
2as they replicate across the internet ( Simmons et al. ,2011). Often memes do not
make unbiased references but are imbued with opinions. In memes, the intertwining
of informational and normative inﬂuence is abundantly clear ( Cialdini and Goldstein ,
2004).
Although many studies highlight the fact that online content references current
societal events, topicality has yet to be studied more broadly. We introduce formal
deﬁnitions of topicality in Section 3. Informally, when a particular topic is widely
prevailing, it is said to be topical.
Topic analysis can be used to connect internet memes to the broader societal
themes that they reference. Memes are not made in a tabula rasa environment but can
be grouped by their topics, which in turn makes them relevant. Liking and re-posting
are implicit endorsements of the memes’ topics and opinions ( Spitzberg ,2014), imply-
ing that topics may inﬂuence meme diﬀusion. Indeed, previous research shows that
individuals are more likely to spread information about topics of interest to them.
Twitter users are more likely to adopt hashtags that align with their own topical inter-
ests (Grabowicz et al. ,2016) and retweet hashtags that they have already tweeted
about in the past ( Weng et al. ,2012). Typically, the diﬀusion of memes through
the internet is modeled as a simple contagion process, similar to the spread of dis-
ease (Wang and Wood ,2011), however, topical content clearly exhibits more complex
diﬀusion mechanisms. Poux-Médard et al. studied the interactions between topics in
the diﬀusion of information on Reddit news pages, showing that the topics of pre-
vious posts have minor explanatory power for predicting the topics of subsequent
posts ( Poux-Médard et al. ,2022). These analyses suggest that topics are interrelated
and exhibit popularity trends.
The majority of previous research using topic analysis models such as Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) ( Blei et al. ,2003) and BERTopic ( Grootendorst ,2022)
on social media data focuses on the topical interests of internet users. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to address topicality comprehensively. Weng
and Menczer show that if a particular hashtag on Twitter is adopted by people with
diverse topical interests, the hashtag is more likely to go viral, due to exposure to a
diverse, and presumably broadly connected, community ( Weng and Menczer ,2015).
In other cases, homogeneous communities with strong central ﬁgures promote content
virality when the topic of the shared content matches the interest of the community
members, implying the importance of shared beliefs and attitudes ( Cialdini and Gold-
stein,2004). Preferential attachment can be described via topical analysis as well. For
example, Instagram users tend to connect with other users with the same interests as
them ( Ferrara et al. ,2014). All of these topic analyses only used one document corpus
to deﬁne and analyze topics, whereas our analysis uses a benchmark dataset (NYT)
to identify the topics of Reddit memes, rather than simply extracting topics from the
memes themselves. This comparative aspect leads to better-identiﬁed topics and can
provide insight for other cross-corpus topic analyses.
In our previous work, we showed that Reddit memes with COVID-19-related con-
tent were more likely to go viral in March 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic than
memes without COVID-19-related content ( Barnes et al. ,2021). Other events likely
exhibit similar properties. We assume that, in general, topical posts about subjects

captioning, and meme topic assignments.
that are currently widely discussed in society are more likely to go viral online. In the
present work, we investigate this hypothesis using the New York Times (NYT) as a
reference document for topicality. Speciﬁc contributions are listed below.
•Identiﬁcation of Reddit- and NYT-based topics.
•Comparing the temporal distributions of 120 topics on Reddit and NYT.
•Showing that Reddit posts about topics that are gaining prevalence in the NYT
also receive more upvotes on Reddit, including an innovator’s advantage for being
among the ﬁrst to post about a topic.
•Demonstrating topic-based features have signiﬁcant predictive power in meme
virality prediction.
In order to establish these ﬁndings, we performed a topical analysis of NYT and
Reddit data sets, engineered topic-based features, and used these to predict viral
memes with a CatBoost classiﬁer ( Prokhorenkova et al. ,2018). The research workﬂow
is summarized in Figure 1. Section 2discusses the data sets and engineering of control
features describing the Reddit memes. Topicality features, describing topics extrinsic
and intrinsic to the Reddit data, are discussed in Section 3. Section 4discusses the
training of a Catboost classiﬁcation model to predict viral memes using these topic-
based features. We analyze the incremental predictive power of topicality features over
other content-based control features, as well as the importance of intrinsic vs. extrinsic
topicality features in the same section.
2 Data Description and Preparation
Data was collected from two sources: image-with-text memes from a popular social
media site called Reddit, discussed in Section 2.1, and archived article metadata from

each meme received.
the New York Times (NYT), see Section 2.2. Sections 2.3and2.4discuss the engineer-
ing of content-based control features such as the color content of meme images and
the sentiment of meme texts. Both data sets can be found on Github ( HSDS ,2024).
2.1 Reddit
Reddit, nicknamed "the front page of the internet", is the source of a lot of viral
internet data, making it likely that the viral content analyzed here also circulates else-
where on the internet ( Sanderson and Rigby ,2013). Data from r/Memes, the largest
community dedicated to sharing memes on Reddit, were collected using the Pushift
API ( Baumgartner et al. ,2020;Boe,2016;Podolak ,2021). We limited the collection
to a maximum of 1000 randomly sampled posts per day. There were 37 missing dates
from which we were unable to collect data due to issues with the API. After removing
items with broken image links and gifs, the Reddit data set contained 899,766 memes
from between January 1, 2018 and November 14, 2022. The r/Memes subreddit is the
12th largest community on Reddit, with more than 26 million subscribers. Based on
the above characteristics, we believe that the collected data is representative and our
conclusions can be applied to memes appearing elsewhere.
In addition to the meme images, the API provides several metadata features includ-
ing the title and caption posted with the meme, publication date, an over-18 content
indicator variable, the number of comments, and the score. On Reddit, the score of a
post is calculated as the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes it received.
These attributes provide opportunities to engineer various other features.
As visualized in the memes’ score distribution in Figure 2, few memes receive a
lot of attention, while the vast majority go unnoticed. In general, memes with high
scores also receive more comments, reﬂected by the Spearman rank-order correlation
coeﬃcient of r= 0.65(p <0.001). In many places on the internet including Reddit,
popular content whether measured by likes, followers, or views, is sorted to the top of

users’ news feeds ( Figueiredo et al. ,2014). Reddit’s default content sorting algorithm,
used to curate the “hot” tab, prioritizes content based on a mixture of how recently it
was posted and the logarithm of the score ( Amir Salihefendic ,2015). Content ranking
methods such as this create a feedback loop between what is popular and what is
visible online. While unpopular memes are visible brieﬂy when they are ﬁrst posted,
popular memes are widely viewed. One study manipulated the score of Reddit posts,
ﬁnding that by providing 10 upvotes soon after the content was posted they could
greatly increase the posts’ chance of going viral ( Carman et al. ,2018). This can explain
the heavy-tailed distribution of popularity measures on many sites, including in our
Reddit data.
It is a common choice to model the heavy-tailed popularity distributions on social
media as binary variables ( Weng and Menczer ,2015;Ling et al. ,2021). Here, we deﬁne
virality as a percentile. If a given meme is in the top 5 percent of memes posted within
a±7-day period around it, it is labeled viral (1), and otherwise, it is labeled non-viral
(0). By measuring virality locally, in a two-week period, we avoid replicating seasonal
popularity trends on Reddit. Additionally, as the Reddit userbase is constantly grow-
ing (Tiago Biachi ,2023), this assures we do not overstate the inﬂuence of memes from
recent years. The viral/non-viral target variable, also visualized in Figure 2, is used
in the binary classiﬁcation task discussed in Section 4.
Table 1summarizes all features describing the Reddit meme data. Shaded rows
indicate features used for training the predictive model, including topicality-related
features (red) and control features (gray).
62.2 New York Times
Data from the same timeframe as the Reddit memes, January 1 2018 to November
14, 2022, was collected from the New York Times Archives API1. The API returns all
article metadata for a given month, including the abstract, snippet, lead paragraph,
headline, publication date, keywords, and type of material. Most (72%) of the col-
lected data was from the news section, but other types of material such as crosswords,
obituaries, sports, and book reviews were also included. The NYT published roughly
200 articles per day on weekdays and 100 articles per day on weekends, and publishing
rates showed a slight decline over the 5-year period we examined. On a few dates, the
archives contained more than 500 items on a single day due to the NYT updating the
archived podcast episodes, or, during the ﬁrst year of the COVID-19 pandemic and
during US elections, due to state-by-state statistics reports. These statistics reports
and podcasts were removed to prevent the topic models from forming topics speciﬁc to
this type of post and to ensure an even daily distribution of articles. No other statis-
tics that should be handled similarly were identiﬁed. After removing these entries, our
data set contained 255,783 NYT articles in total.
2.3 Text features
We extracted text from the Reddit meme images using Optical Character Recog-
nition2, and generated image captions using Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-
training (BLIP) ( Li et al. ,2022). Examples of OCR and image caption results can
be seen in Figure 1. The OCR text and image captions were combined with the title
and caption posted with the meme image on Reddit into one feature containing all
text associated with the meme. This all-text feature was subsequently used for topic
extraction and assignment in the Reddit data. In the NYT data set, the abstract,
snippet, lead paragraph, headline, and keywords were all combined into one all-text
feature for topic extraction.
The all-text features for the Reddit and NYT data were cleaned identically to
assure alignment when modeling the topics in both document corpora. We removed
punctuation, made the text lowercase, removed stop words, and stemmed the words to
their root forms using NLTK ( Bird et al. ,2009). Additionally, we made custom edits
to the NYT text data based on observed diﬀerences between the NYT and Reddit
vernaculars. For example, the NYT referred to the COVID-19 pandemic with the
word “coronavirus” whereas posts on Reddit tended to use “covid”, “rona”, “corona”,
and “pandemic”. This is important as the LDA algorithm identiﬁes and assigns topics
based on shared words. Therefore, if a post on Reddit referred to “covid”, it would not
necessarily be associated with an NYT topic that only included the word “coronavirus”.
To solve this issue, we added the words “covid”, “rona”, “corona”, and “pandemic”
to the all-text feature of every NYT article that was tagged with the NYT keyword
“Coronavirus”. Other examples include adding “RGB” to articles tagged with Ruth
Bater Ginsberg and “BLM” to articles tagged with Black Lives Matter. Additionally,
acronyms of the form “G.O.P.” and “N.F.L.” were edited to “GOP” and “NFL” in
1https://developer.nytimes.com/apis
2OCR.space Free OCR API and Online OCR, https://ocr.space/
7order to not lose this information when punctuation was removed in the text cleaning
process.
In addition to text cleaning, we extracted numerical features from the Reddit text
data. These features were used as control features describing the Reddit memes for
classiﬁcation. As seen in Table 1, we recorded the number of characters in the title
posted with the meme and the OCR text extracted from the meme image. Other
studies show that on Twitter, the length of the post is strongly correlated with pop-
ularity ( Tsur and Rappoport ,2015). A binary variable indicating whether or not
the all-text feature contained emojis was engineered using the Emoji 2.8.0 identiﬁ-
cation Python library ( Kim and Wurster ,2023). The valence of the Reddit title and
OCR-extracted text was analyzed with the NLTK sentiment model ( Shreyas ,2019).
Sentiment scores close to 1 are more positive while sentiment scores close to 0 represent
more negative sentiment.
2.4 Image features
In addition to text features, we extracted numerical features from the meme images
following a similar procedure to our previous work ( Barnes et al. ,2021). In total, we
used 19 image-related features, including high-level features such as the BLIP image
descriptions discussed in the previous section and low-level features such as the color
content of the images.
The pre-trained Multi-Task Cascading Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN)
was used to detect faces in the meme images ( Zhang et al. ,2016). The model returned
the probability that a face was present and the number of faces present in the image.
For simplicity, we elected to use a binary variable indicating whether or not the meme
image contained a face. Using the OpenCV image segmentation technique to mask the
meme images, we calculated what percentage of the image area contained each of 10
color ( Stone,2018). The average hue, saturation, and value components of the HSV
representation of the images and the average red, green, and blue components of the
RGB image were also used as control features.
Previous work has shown that low-level image features such as those mentioned
above can have a large eﬀect on popularity ( Russakovsky et al. ,2015;Khosla et al. ,
2014). However, while an earlier study on the aesthetics of images shows that high-
deﬁnition, bright-colored images are more appealing ( Datta et al. ,2006), in the case
of memes it is the opposite. Popular memes generally contain dull colors ( Barnes
et al.,2021). For memes, these low-level features could encode the template image used
to create memes, indicating that meme templates rather than the low-level features
themselves, have an impact on popularity ( Coscia ,2014).
3 Topic Modeling
Using two topic models, LDA and BERTopic, we analyzed the topics of Reddit memes
and NYT articles. For comparison, we used top models from both paradigms of topic
modeling: probabilistic (LDA) and embedding (BERTopic) approaches ( Egger and
Yu,2022). Each topic is represented by a list of its most common words, as shown
in the example topics in Tables 2and3. To identify “extrinsic topics” (NYT-based),

Table 2 : Most common LDA-identiﬁed topics in NYT and Reddit corpora. Words are

we trained the topic models on the NYT data and performed inference on the Reddit
data. To determine “intrinsic topics” (Reddit-based), the topic models were trained
on and inference was performed on the Reddit text data. From the distributions of
each topic over time we deﬁned topicality features for the Reddit data. In total, 12
topicality features were added for each topic model. This is twice the number listed
in Table 1because the features were calculated using both the extrinsic and intrinsic
topic models.
In this section, we discuss the LDA topic model (Section 3.1), the BERTopic model
(Section 3.2), and the formalization of topicality into numerical features (Section 3.3).
At the end of Section 3.3we report statistics describing the relation between topi-
cality features and the popularity of the Reddit memes. We display plots comparing
topicality trends from the the past 5 years of NYT and Reddit memes data. The inter-
ested reader can see the complete sets of NYT-based topics identiﬁed by LDA and
BERTopic on our GitHub page ( HSDS ,2024).
3.1 Latent Dirichlet Allocation
LDA is a statistical language model used to distill topics from a corpus of docu-
ments using a bag-of-words approach in which word order is not considered. Words
that commonly co-occur in documents are grouped into topics. Topics are then rep-
resented as a probability distribution over all of the words in the document corpus,

with the words most highly associated with the given topic receiving the highest prob-
abilities. In the inference step, the word distributions of the topics are compared with
the word distributions of each document to assess the probabilities with which each
document discusses each single topic. Documents are then represented as probability
distributions over the set of topics ( Blei et al. ,2003).
One limitation of the LDA algorithm is the requirement to specify the number of
topics in advance. We used the keywords metadata provided by the NYT to estimate
an appropriate number of topics in the NYT data set. The NYT indexed 1,583,868
unique keywords covering 92% of the articles, the most used keywords being “US
Politics and Government”, “Trump, Donald J.”, and “Coronavirus (2020-nCov)”. We
ﬁltered the keywords list based on three criteria. The keyword should be used, 1. at
least 100 times total, 2. on at least 50 distinct dates, and 3. at least 5 times on at least
one day. Only, 127 unique keywords ﬁt these criteria, providing an estimated number
of topics for the NYT corpus, which we rounded down to 120 for simplicity.
The NYT all-text feature was used to train the LDA model parameterized to ﬁnd
120 topics in 1500 iterations over the corpus. We labeled articles in the NYT corpus
according to their highest probability topic. Table 2shows that the most prevalent
topics identiﬁed in the NYT data are about US politics & government and Coronavirus.
This aligns with the most common NYT-applied keywords, lending conﬁdence to our
model. Using the trained LDA model we then performed inference on the Reddit all-
textfeature, resulting in a topic distribution assigned to each meme in the Reddit data,
10which described the probability that the meme is about each of the 120 NYT-based
topics. Later, we will refer to this topic distribution as the vector, τm.
We labeled the Reddit memes according to their highest probability topic, saving
that topic’s probability of being assigned to the meme as well. Additionally, we cal-
culated the Shannon’s entropy of the memes’ topic distributions. Memes uniformly
assigned to all topics receive high entropy values while memes with few dominant
topics receive low entropy values. These are the "topic", "prob" and "topic entropy"
features described in Table 1.
In the same manner, a set of 120 intrinsic topics (500 iterations over the Reddit
corpus) was extracted by training the LDA algorithm on the Reddit all-text feature.
In this case, we chose 120 topics to be consistent with the NYT-based topic set. Again,
the highest probability intrinsic topic, its associated probability, and the Shannon’s
entropy of the topic distribution were saved for the Reddit memes.
Both the intrinsic and extrinsic topic models created one miscellaneous topic in
which the most important words in the topic were common words like “already”, “life”,
“way”, “time” and “person”. This topic was the most prevalent in both the NYT and
Reddit corpora, but it did not dominate the data sets. In both cases, the miscellaneous
topic was assigned to less than 10% of the documents. Table 2shows the top 2 most
frequent topics in the Reddit and NYT data excluding this miscellaneous topic.
3.2 BERTopic
BERTopic is a newer topic modeling technique that uses a transformer based
approach ( Grootendorst ,2022). The model generates high-dimensional document
embeddings, reduces the dimensionality of these embeddings with UMAP, and then
clusters the vectors into topic groups using HDBSCAN. Word order is important for
the transformer-based model to understand the context of texts therefore notably,
word order was not changed during the text cleaning steps described in Section 2.3.
To ensure comparability, we used the same text data for both the BERTopic and LDA
models.
A set of 120 extrinsic topics was extracted using BERTopic from the NYT all-
textdocument corpus, and inference was run on the Reddit all-text corpus to assign
these extrinsic topics to the Reddit memes. Although it is not necessary to specify
the number of topics before ﬁtting BERTopic, the number of topics can be reduced
after training. Our BERTopic model was parameterized to cluster topics containing
at least 100 documents, resulting in 194 NYT topics. This was reduced to a set of
120 topics, to match the LDA model, using automatic and manual approaches. We
applied BERTopic’s default topic-reduction technique which merges the most similar
HDBSCAN clusters. Additionally, we qualitatively assessed the similarity of topics’
word distributions and manually merged those that were most similar. We trained
a second BERTopic model to ﬁnd 120 intrinsic topics, using only the Reddit all-text
features, following the same procedure.
As with the LDA model, BERTopic initially generated miscellaneous topics with
common words such as “like” and “also”. These topics were manually combined into
one miscellaneous topic which, again was the most prevalent topic assigned to both

the NYT and Reddit data. However, again this topic accounted for less than 10% of
the data sets.
A disadvantage of BERTopic is the number of outliers produced. These are doc-
uments that are not assigned to any topic. To address this, we used the BERTopic
calculate probabilities parameter to calculate the probability each document belonged
to every topic. Then, we automatically assigned every document to its highest proba-
bility topic, resulting in no outlier documents. Furthermore, this parameter was used
to match the LDA results, in which every document is represented by a probability
distribution over the topics, τm. As in the case of the LDA model, we supplemented
the meme data with the highest probability topic, its probability, and the Shannon’s
entropy of the topic distribution.
The BERTopic and LDA topic models obtained similar results. As shown in
Figure 3, there was a considerable amount of overlap between the topics found by the
LDA and BERTopic models, and their 5-year temporal distributions. Table 3shows
the top 2 most common topics identiﬁed by BERTopic in the NYT and Reddit data
sets. In the NYT, the most prevalent topics were those that the NYT publishes about
regularly, such as arts events, real estate, and sports. COVID-19 and the invasion of

BERTopic.
Ukraine were the only two current events that appeared in the top 10 NYT topics.
Notably, topics about police brutality and sexual assault were among the top 10 most
prevalent NYT-based topics in the memes data as identiﬁed by both models, but these
topics were not as prevalent in the NYT data.
Although NYT and Reddit follow many of the same topicality trends, the pro-
portions with which they publish about these topics diﬀers. This can be seen in the
stream charts in Figure 4. The NYT publishes much more about the arts, economics
and real estate than Reddit, whereas Reddit posts are more likely to discuss animals
and technology than the NYT. Notably, current events are discussed at length in the
NYT, but on Reddit interest in these topics declines rapidly after the date of the
event. The impact of Covid-19 on NYT publishing is also evident in Figure 4as live
events such as theater performances, weddings and fashion week were cancelled due
13to the pandemic. Moreover, the eﬀect of Reddit outages, when the website was down
for 5-10 hours in 2019 and 2021, can also be observed.
3.3 Topicality Features
In addition to saving the topic, probability and topic entropy for each Reddit meme,
we developed variables to assess whether trending, “topical”, topics were more popu-
lar than non-trending topics. These variables were calculated for both the LDA and
BERTopic models and for both the NYT-based, extrinsic topics and the Reddit-based,
intrinsic topics.
3.3.1 Deﬁning Trending Topics
First, we deﬁne trending topics in terms of how frequently they were published about
on given dates. This topicality variable, τt(d), was calculated as the normalized sum
of the probability with which documents were assigned to a given topic ton a given
dated. Formally,
τt(d) =/summationtext
a∈Adpa(t)
|Ad|, (1)
whereAdis the set of articles published on date dandpa(t)is the probability that doc-
umentais about topic t. Note that τt(d)can be calculated for either daily or monthly
granularity. Figures 3and4show monthly topic trends, meaning din equation ( 1) was
the month and year in which the document was posted. Figures 5and6, on the other
hand, show daily topic trends, meaning dwas the date on which the document was
posted. Furthermore, τt(d)was calculated for both NYT articles and Reddit memes.
We use “document” to refer to either an article or a meme. The blue lines in the
above-mentioned ﬁgures show NYT distributions in which ain equation ( 1) represents
NYT articles, whereas for the red lines, arepresents Reddit memes. The plots serve
to compare topical trends in the NYT and Reddit and thus are only based on the sets
of extrinsic topics.
Topics about current events typically exhibited a rapid spike followed by a slower
decline. Oscillating topics appeared for sports events, holidays and other regular cel-
ebrations such as Pride. In many topics, like the invasion of Ukraine and Christmas
holidays shown in Figure 3, the distribution of Reddit memes posted about the given
topics aligns very well with the distribution of NYT articles. In other topics, such as
the marriage and romance topic in Figure 3, the two sources diﬀer. We can also see
that while the topic models identify the documents associated with each topic well,
they are not perfect. For example, some NYT articles about Russian interference in
the US 2020 presidential elections are associated with the topic of the invasion of
Ukraine by the LDA topic model, as seen in the spike in 2020 in the LDA Ukraine
invasion topic in Figure 3. This is likely due to words about Russia being prevelent in
both topics. Despite this disadvantage, the identiﬁed topics describe the majority of
the memes well for both algorithms used.

15Fig. 6 : LDA-identiﬁed topical alignments between the NYT and Reddit.
163.3.2 Deﬁning Topical Memes
Equation ( 1) and the corresponding charts describing trending topics can be sued to
identify which memes are topical and which are not. Here, we consider Reddit memes
topical if they are about events which are currently on the rise in NYT publishing.
Visually, memes published about a given topic when there is a spike in the corre-
sponding NYT distribution ( e.g.on the date of the current event) are considered
topical.
Applying equation ( 1) for each topic on the NYT document corpus results in
topicality vectors with a length of 120 for each date d,τd, describing how frequently
each topic was being discussed on a given month or day in the 5 years that our data
span. This vector can be formalized as,
τd=/summationdisplay
t∈Tτt(d)·it, (2)
whereTis the set of topics, and itis the unit vector on |T|coordinates with the
coordinate corresponding to topic tbeing 1.
Using the topicality vector τdand the topic distribution τmassigned to a meme
min the model inference step, we deﬁne the topicality of a Reddit meme mas,
topm=τdm·τm (3)
whereτdmis the topicality distribution of the reference data (NYT for extrinsic topics,
Reddit for intrinsic topics) on the given date dmthat the meme mwas posted, and
τmis the topic distribution assigned to the particular meme instance.
Note that again, this can be calculated for either a daily or monthly granularity,
meaning dmis either the day on which the meme mwas posted or the month in which
the meme was posted. Thus, equation ( 3) was used to deﬁne the "daily topicality"
and "monthly topicality" features listed in Table 1. We suspect the monthly topicality
variable to have reduced noise. For example, the monthly average topicality for the
holidays topic, seen in Figure 3, is higher for all memes posted in December due to the
eﬀect of Christmas, but the daily average topicality variable has higher values only on
the few days around Christmas and the other holidays.
In addition to the daily and monthly topicality features, reﬂecting how frequently a
given topic was being discussed in the NYT or Reddit, we designed a feature describing
the slope of the daily topicality distributions (e.g. Figure 6). This was calculated as
the average slope of the reference data distribution for the ±2days around when the
meme was posted. Given that topics about current events tend to spike rapidly, we
used a small time frame. This is the "slope topicality" feature in Table 1. We suspect
that a topic will be more popular on Reddit when the topicality distribution has a
positive slope, indicating increasing topicality trends.
Two binary topicality features were engineered based on the slope and daily top-
icality features. These binary variables were used for statistical tests showing that
topical memes are more popular than non-topical memes. The ﬁrst binary topicality
variable, visualized in Figure 7a, indicates whether the meme’s topic is being posted

about more (labeled 1) or less (labeled 0) than average in NYT on the date the meme
was posted. The second binary variable, visualized in Figure 7b, was calculated based
on the slope topicality. This variable takes the values 1 when the slope of the reference
topicality distribution is positive, and 0 when the slope of the distribution is negative.
The cross-tabulation of these two binary topicality variables makes a categorical
topicality feature with 4 categories. This categorical feature indicates both whether
the slope of the reference distribution was positive or negative on the date when the
meme was posted and whether the topic was being published about more or less than
average on the date when the meme was posted. Figure 7cshows category 1 when
the slope of the reference distribution is positive but the topic is not yet being posted
about more than average.
Table 4reports t-tests comparing the number of upvotes recieved by topical and
non-topical memes by these binary variables. On average, memes about topics that
show increasing, positive slope, topicality trends receive a higher score than memes
about topics with decreasing topicality trends. There is an additional innovators advan-
tage for memes posted right when a topic is beginning to gain popularity in the
NYT (ﬁgure 7c). Diﬀerences between the other groups, for which T-test results were
not reported, were not signiﬁcant. Taken together, these results indicate that memes
posted about a topic which has recently hit the news receive more upvotes on aver-
age. Topicality has a positive eﬀect on Reddit popularity, however this eﬀect doesn’t
18endure long after the date of the event, as indicated by the non-signiﬁcant results of
the ﬁgure 7avariable.
4 Identifying Viral Memes
In order to gain a better understanding of how topicality inﬂuences the virality of
a meme, we trained a CatBoost classiﬁer. CatBoost, an ensemble learning algorithm
for gradient boosting on decision trees, has also been shown to outperform other
algorithms on a variety of problems ( Ibrahim et al. ,2020). The classiﬁer is able to
parse categorical features, meaning the 120-category topic features did not have to
be one-hot-encoded before training. We used the image, text, and topicality features
summarized in the shaded rows of Table 1for the binary classiﬁcation task of identi-
fying viral memes in our Reddit data. Figure 8shows the algorithm’s performance in
identifying viral memes.
Fig. 8 : ROC and features importances results identifying Reddit meme virality with
CatBoost model
The binary target variable was highly unbalanced because it was deﬁned as a
percentile: only the top 5 percent of Reddit memes were considered viral. We used
the CatBoost weighting parameter to improve performance on the imbalanced class
prediction. The CatBoost classiﬁer was trained using data from 763,388 memes and
tested using 84,821 memes. The model was ﬁne-tuned with 5-fold cross-validation,
and sklearn’s GridSearchCV for parameter selection. Notably, the title length feature
is the most important for classifying viral memes. Memes posted with short titles
perform better than memes accompanied by a lot of text. This mirrors earlier work
showing brevity is the most important feature for viral tweets ( Tsur and Rappoport ,
2015). The reason could be that messages that are easier to convey are understood
better. Given the importance of the text length variable, we used CatBoost’s per-ﬂoat-
feature-quantization parameter to increase the number of decision boundaries allowed
for this feature, taking advantage of its predictive power.
19The classiﬁer was trained separately for the LDA-based and BERTopic-based top-
icality feature sets. In order to estimate the importance of the topic-based features
for predicting meme virality, we trained the CatBoost model with diﬀerent subsets
of features. The ﬁrst models were trained using only topicality features, highlighted
red in Table 1. Alone, the topicality features (AUCs: LDA=0.64, BERTopic=0.57) are
already able to predict meme virality better than a random guess (AUC=0.5).
Fig. 9 : SHAP values for extrinsic topicality features indicating that topicality posi-
tively aﬀects the CatBoost probability memes are predicted viral.
It could be the case that the explanatory power of the topicality features is already
contained by information in the control features set. To test this, we trained the
model with only control features, described in Sections 2.3and2.4. Then, we assessed
the incremental predictive power of topicality features over control features. Models
trained with the entire feature set, all shaded rows in Table 1, were better able to
identify viral memes than the model trained with only the control features set. We
tested the statistical signiﬁcance of these AUC diﬀerences using a procedure from
previous research ( Hanley and McNeil ,1982), ﬁnding the engineered topicality features
have signiﬁcant predictive power over the control features for both BERTopic ( AUC=
0.71,p <0.01) and LDA ( AUC= 0.73,p <0.001). Results were more signiﬁcant
for the LDA topic model, and topicality features ranked higher in the LDA features
importances than for BERTopic, as seen in Figure 8.
Figure 9shows the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values for given extrin-
sic topicality features ( Lundberg and Lee ,2017). The text length feature, which is
negatively correlated with meme virality, is provided for reference – memes with fewer
words have a higher probability of being viral. The topicality features on the other
hand correspond positively with the CatBoost’s estimation of meme virality. Memes
with higher daily and monthly topicality values are generally labeled 1, viral, with a
higher probability by the CatBoost model than memes with lower topicality values.
Interestingly, higher values of topic entropy and topic probability also have a positive
eﬀect on the CatBoost outcome. This suggests that memes with a strong dominant
topic, and high probability, but otherwise mixed topic distributions, and high entropy
20have higher probabilities of going viral. The topicality features positively impact the
CatBoost’s estimation of meme virality.
5 Conclusion
While NYT and Reddit are qualitatively very diﬀerent sources of information, they
do show signiﬁcant alignment. NYT-based topics are good descriptors and predictors
of popular Reddit memes. Here we showed:
•Many topics on Reddit and the NYT show similar topicality distributions.
•Memes that are about topics with increasing topicality trends in the NYT receive
more upvotes on average.
•“Innovator” memes posted when a topic is just beginning to be prevalent in the news
receive the most upvotes.
These ﬁndings can be interpreted from the perspective of agenda-setting theory,
which states that media sources shape the interests of society by selecting which
topics to publish about. Our ﬁnding that news topicality has a positive eﬀect on social
media virality also indicates that it may be harder to get attention for and spread
non-topicality information. This study does not unveil a causal link between topics in
NYT and on Reddit, however, the great overlap between the sources indicates that
topically they exert similar inﬂuence on their audiences. Future research could delve
into diﬀerences between the opinions purported by news and social media about the
same topics.
Articles from many disciplines explore the diﬀusion of internet memes through
online sites. Our results showing that topicality plays a role in meme popularity,
suggest that topics and topicality should be taken into account to model the more
complex diﬀusion process of online media.
Most topic analyses have analyzed the relationship between user topical interests
and content. Our analyses of topics in general and the use of a reference document to
assess the topicality of the topics is a unique contribution. Deﬁning topicality based on
only the NYT can also be seen as a limitation of this work. It would be an interesting
challenge to develop a more complete description of what subjects are topical on the
internet by combining multiple reference documents. While NYT does report on global
events and on issues other than news, using NYT as a source document skewed our
set of topics to be more USA- and politics-centered. The USA-skewed results were
appropriate for our purposes to match the large proportion of Reddit users based out
of the USA, 48% of all users ( Tiago Biachi ,2023). However, this means our results
are less relevant to other parts of the globe.
Finally, the results presented here contribute to the growing body of research mod-
eling multi-modal data. With the rise of internet communication, multi-modality is
a paradigm shift in the forms discourse takes in general. Predicting the popularity
of multimedia content is more diﬃcult than text-only data. For example, impressive
results have been achieved predicting viral tweets ( Weng et al. ,2012;Tsur and Rap-
poport ,2015), but we have not yet seen such success predicting the popularity of
21image-with-text memes. One article achieved an AUC of 0.86 predicting image-with-
text memes, but they worked with a small data set labeled by hand by humans, and
kept only the highest and lowest scoring memes, thereby eliminating all moderately-
popular memes and reducing the diﬃculty of the problem ( Ling et al. ,2021). Recent
improvements in generative AI will soon make modeling multi-modal content more
tractable. For now, predicting multi-modal content remains a challenge, and our AUC
of 0.73 stands out in the literature.
With the increasing availability of internet data, social media has become a popu-
lar source of data for academics. Reddit is an especially popular data source, and the
ethical guidelines around using this data are not yet ﬁrmly established. In light of this,
we heed recommendations from studies surveying social media users about research
data use. Namely, we collected data from a large, public community, assured no per-
sonal identifying information was associated with the data, and we plan to share our
results back to Reddit upon completion ( Proferes et al. ,2021).
